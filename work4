1) Strona www (one-page) — struktura i content (EN)
A. Layout / jak ma wyglądać (UX)
Above the fold (pierwszy ekran):
Mocny nagłówek + 1 zdanie wartości
2 przyciski segmentujące:


WtE: Request availability check
Cement: Request availability check


3 krótkie “proof points” (czas reakcji / geografia / typy okien)
Zero lania wody. Minimum scrolla zanim użytkownik zobaczy “co dalej”.


Dalej:
Sekcja “What we do” (neutralna)
Sekcja dwie kolumny: WtE vs Cement (use cases + wymagania)
“How it works” (4 kroki)
“What we need” (intake requirements – formularz)
FAQ (krótkie)
Kontakt + calendly


Ważne:
Jedno CTA powtarzane co 2–3 sekcje.
Strona ma wyglądać “operacyjnie”: jak narzędzie, nie jak broszura.

HERO
Title: RDF/SRF supply alignment for Waste-to-Energy and Cement kilns across Europe
 Subtitle: We coordinate counterparties and align acceptance, timing and commercials — enabling backup coverage and spot volumes with fast decision cycles.
 CTAs:
WtE: Request availability check
Cement: Request availability check
 Micro-points:


Same-day feasibility checks (where possible)
Spot slots + backup coverage
EU-wide counterparty mapping



WHAT WE DO
Heading: What we handle
Pre-contractual alignment between intake needs and available RDF/SRF streams
Rapid market checks for spot/backup volumes
Consolidation of acceptance constraints and timing windows
Commercial alignment to accelerate “yes/no” decisions


Scope note (małe, ale widoczne):
 We do not provide transport or compliance services. We coordinate and align counterparties.

TWO SEGMENTS (2 kolumny)
WtE operators
Typical situations
Contract gaps requiring backup volumes
Short-notice intake windows
Spec-driven shortages (e.g., CV/moisture/Cl constraints)
Downtime risk reduction via alternative streams


What we need (minimum)
Timing window + lead time
Weekly/monthly volume range
Your “red lines” (key acceptance thresholds)


Cement kilns
Typical situations
Additional intake slots (spot windows)
Temporary substitution vs other fuels
Balancing supply variability and kiln constraints
Price/spec-driven opportunities


What we need (minimum)
Approved fuel type (RDF/SRF) and key limits
Intake windows + max weekly throughput
Delivery/unloading constraints (if any)



HOW IT WORKS
Heading: Simple 4-step process
You share intake requirements + timing window
We run a targeted availability check across counterparties
We return a short “offer pack” (feasible options + constraints)
You confirm acceptance → counterparties proceed to contracting



INTAKE FORM
Heading: Intake requirements (fast submission)
 Fields:
Segment: WtE / Cement
Country / site (optional)
Material: RDF / SRF
Volume range (t/week or t/month)
Timing window (from/to) + lead time
Key acceptance thresholds (“red lines”)
Packaging/unloading constraints (optional)
Contact details



FAQ (krótkie)
Do you sell RDF/SRF? We coordinate counterparties and align supply options.
Do you run logistics? No. Logistics is handled by counterparties.
How fast can you respond? We aim for rapid feasibility checks once requirements are clear.
What geographies do you cover? Europe (cross-border), depending on feasibility.

2) Capability Sheet (1 strona A4) — treść (EN)
Title: RDF/SRF Supply Alignment — WtE & Cement (Europe)
What we do
 We coordinate counterparties to align RDF/SRF supply with WtE and cement kiln intake needs. Our role is pre-contractual alignment: acceptance constraints, timing windows, volume feasibility, and commercial positioning to accelerate decisions and reduce downtime risk.
Core use cases
Backup coverage for temporary gaps
Spot intake windows (short-term slots)
Spec-driven sourcing (constraints-led matching)
Alternative counterparties to reduce supply risk


How we work (4 steps)
Intake requirements and timing window
Targeted market check
Offer pack with feasible options + constraints
Acceptance confirmation → contracting between counterparties


What we need to run a check
Volume range (weekly/monthly)
Timing window + lead time
Key acceptance thresholds (“red lines”)
Site constraints (unloading/packaging) if applicable


Scope
We coordinate and align counterparties
No transport execution
No compliance services (handled by counterparties)


Coverage
 Europe (cross-border), feasibility dependent on requirements and timing.
