FINALNY BRIEF DLA FREELANCERA – copy-paste ready
1) Project goal
Build a heavy B2B corporate landing page for WTE Flow, positioned as a cross-border coordination desk for RDF/SRF intake planning across Europe. The site must communicate operational credibility (windows, specs, lane constraints) and drive qualified Operator/Supplier inquiries via a dual-entry intake form. This is not SaaS, not an agency site, and not e-commerce.
2) Target audience
Waste-to-Energy plant operators (planning / procurement / operations)


Cement kilns (alternative fuels / sourcing / planning)


MRF/MBT operators


Professional RDF/SRF suppliers


Traders / sourcing managers


3) What the site is NOT
Not a SaaS product (“demo”, “platform”, “AI” language is forbidden)


Not an agency/service studio vibe


Not eco storytelling / impact narrative


No client logos, no fake partnerships, no unverifiable performance claims


4) Required page structure (final)
Sticky top bar: brand + nav + “Request availability” CTA


Hero: clear definition + dual-entry clarity


Replace “snapshot” with Operators/Suppliers info panel: “Inputs we need / What you get”


“What teams use WTE Flow for” use-case section (no “Proof” label)


Capabilities (5 cards with fixed copy provided below)


How it works (4-step coordination flow)


Specs & constraints section (industrial credibility anchor)


FAQ (scope + typical questions)


Contact section: dual-entry Buyer/Supplier form (qualification)


Minimal footer: email + one neutral scope line


5) UX/UI rules
UI style: industrial / trading desk / corporate, dark theme, layered surfaces, crisp borders


Primary goal: qualification > persuasion


CTA: “Request availability” only (anchors to contact)


Motion: subtle reveal/hover only; no flashy animations; respect reduced motion


Mobile: clean stacking, dual entry as tabs or segmented control


6) Fixed Capabilities copy (must be verbatim)
Availability mapping
 “We track live availability windows and delivery constraints across active lanes.”


Spec verification
 “We align NCV, chlorine, moisture, and size before parties invest time.”


Lane coordination
 “We coordinate cross-border lanes, handoffs, and timing so coverage doesn’t break.”


Contingency routing
 “We prepare fallback options when a window slips or a lane tightens.”


Weekly alignment brief
 “A structured weekly brief: confirmed windows, at-risk coverage, and open asks.”


7) Copy rules
Voice: WE, operational tone


Forbidden words: broker, brokerage, intermediary services, “best/leading”, eco storytelling terms


Allowed language: coordination desk, alignment, intake windows, specs, lane constraints, handoffs, counterparties


8) Functional requirements
Dual-entry intake form: Operator vs Supplier


Required fields listed above


Email delivery must work (existing integration stays)


Disclaimers: single neutral line
 “Coordination and alignment only. Contracting and execution are handled by the parties.”


9) Success criteria (how owner will judge)
In first 5 seconds, a WtE/cement operator understands: what this is and why it exists


Page feels corporate, stable, heavy B2B, not template/startup


Form submissions are qualified (windows/specs/constraints captured)


No risky claims, no fake proof, no “eco” visuals


Desktop and mobile both look controlled and professional
